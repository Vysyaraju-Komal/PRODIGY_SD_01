I recently completed a project where I developed a Python program to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It then seamlessly converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results. For instance, entering 25Â°C will output the equivalent values in Fahrenheit and Kelvin!

This was a fun and practical coding exercise that sharpened my skills in handling user inputs, implementing mathematical conversions, and displaying results in a user-friendly manner.
